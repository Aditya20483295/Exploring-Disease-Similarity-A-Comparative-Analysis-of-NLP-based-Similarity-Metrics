# Exploring-Disease-Similarity-A-Comparative-Analysis-of-NLP-based-Similarity-Metrics

This project employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, including Jaccard similarity, Cosine similarity, and advanced transformer models like BERT and RoBERTa, to detect correlations among diseases. By analyzing symptoms, treatments, risks, causes, and descriptions, the research aims to prevent the onset of specific diseases. The integration of transformer models helps to understand intricate semantic connections within textual data, improving insight into disease associations and facilitating the creation of more efficient preventive measures and personalized healthcare strategies.

The study focuses on developing an NLP-driven system for Disease Classification and Information Retrieval to meet the increasing demand for accessible and insightful healthcare information. It aims to empower healthcare professionals and individuals seeking health-related information by providing in-depth insights into diseases, including causes, symptoms, risk factors, treatments, and preventive measures.

The literature review highlights the dominance of Deep Learning in NLP for tasks like named entity identification and relation extraction in medical contexts. It discusses the significance of Information Extraction (IE) in extracting clinical data from textual records, enabling secondary Electronic Health Record (EHR) utilization.

The research methodology involves preprocessing techniques to handle missing data and isolate information related to specific diseases like glaucoma. It utilizes traditional NLP techniques along with advanced transformer models to capture complex contextual information and determine the similarity between diseases.

The results reveal high similarities between diseases like glaucoma and High Blood Pressure (BP), glaucoma and diabetes, and Whipple's Disease and Stroke, indicating potential correlations. The study concludes that understanding the interconnected nature of diseases can aid in proactive disease prevention and overall well-being.

In summary, this project aims to leverage NLP and ML techniques to detect correlations among diseases, providing valuable insights for healthcare professionals and individuals seeking health-related information.
